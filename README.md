This is a simple demo that shows how to integrate [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-java), 
[RealmAdapter](https://github.com/realm/realm-android-adapters), [Parceler](https://github.com/johncarl81/parceler), and Databinding all together. 
The ListView is populated from a Realm database, you can add or edit items, Realm database gets updated and the data is instantly reflected in the ListView.  
There are two modules:
* app: This module contains the Java implementation.  
* kotlinapp: This module contains the Kotlin implementation.  

This repo is related to the following [post](http://mobiledevhub.com/2018/01/09/android-listview-populating-listview-from-realm/).
